# JiaGo-
This app was built by me and my teammate for our Mobile App Development course. It’s a Chiayi food guide that uses Firebase for backend services, supporting user registration, login, and reviews. Users can browse recommended restaurants by category, view details, save favorites, and use integrated map navigation to explore Chiayi’s local cuisine.
